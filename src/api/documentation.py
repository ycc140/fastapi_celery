**This is a Microservice template that illustrates how to use Celery tasks
and callbacks to keep a responsive API regardless of processing time.**

**The following architectural components are used:**

**Docker**
    *Docker is containerization technology that enables the creation and use of Linux containers.*

**Flower**
    *Flower is an open-source web application for monitoring and managing Celery clusters.
    It provides real-time information about the status of Celery workers and tasks.*

**Celery**
    *Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages,
    while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system.*

**RabbitMQ**
    *RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications
    a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received.*

**MongoDB**
    *MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program that can manage document-oriented information.*

**Uvicorn**
    *Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.*

**Gunicorn**
    *Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It is used in front of Uvicorn to make 
    sure the defined number of workers are always running.*
    
**FastAPI**
    *FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
    based on standard Python type hints.*

**Prism**
    *Prism is an open-source HTTP mock and proxy server.*
    
<br>**The following HTTP status codes are returned:**
  * `200:` Successful GET response.
  * `202:` Successful POST response.
  * `400:` Task ID has the wrong state for a retry (not FAILED).
  * `404:` Task ID not found in DB.
  * `422:` Validation error, supplied parameter(s) are incorrect.
  * `500:` Failed Health response.
  * `500:` Failed Celery task initialisation.
