## Author: Anders Wiklund

This code repository is an extensive FAstAPI example of a RESTful API using Celery. 

Async IO is a vital part of FastAPI, and it will be used where possible in this example.

This repository is described in a number of **Medium** articles.

### Here's a brief outline of the article parts

#### 1. Introduction and installation of required components
This part talks briefly about what Celery is and when to use it. It covers the overall 
architecture of the example and the  installation of required components.

#### 2. A code walkthrough of configuration and tools components
This part is a walkthrough of the code in the configuration and tools directories.

#### 3. A code walkthrough of API components
This part is a walkthrough of the API code.

#### 4. A code walkthrough of main components testing
This part is a walkthrough of the main parts in the FastAPI and Celery distributed task 
code, as well as the tests.

#### 5. How to run the development environment
This part is a walkthrough of the development environment. I have developed this on Windows, 
but I also cover Linux and macOS differences where needed.

#### 6. How to create and run the Docker environment
This part is a walkthrough of the Docker local and prod environment. I have developed this 
on Windows, but I also cover Linux and macOS differences where needed.
